# Prodigy_DS_2

Task: Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

DATASET: [Titanic.csv](Titanic.csv) 

## Observation:
  - Survival depends mostly on Pclass and Fare only
  - 1st class has large Fare
  - Most 1st class people survived while 3rd class people died
  - Most male died while most females survived
  - Those having 1 sibiling or spouse has more chance of surviving 
  - Those having 1 parent or child has more chance of surviving
  - Those who embarked from Cherbourg has great chance of survining
  - People travelling in titanic are mostly male
  - Most people embarked from southampton
  - Most people failed to survive in titanic
  - Most people are travelling from 3rd class
  - Most people age range vary from 20-40 and very few people are above 65
  - Most people are travelling with no sibiling and spouse
  - most people have no parent n children
  - some outliers are present in fare

## Conclusion
Passengers in higher classes (Pclass) with higher fares generally had a better chance of survival. Additionally, those traveling with one sibling/spouse or one parent/child seemed to have a higher likelihood of surviving, possibly due to a sense of responsibility or shared decision-making during the evacuation. However, further analysis is needed to explore if these relationships hold true after accounting for other factors and to investigate the potential reasons behind them.
This initial EDA suggests that social class, family dynamics, and potentially even embarkation port (Cherbourg) played a role in survival outcomes
